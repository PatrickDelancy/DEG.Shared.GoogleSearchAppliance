DEG.Shared.GoogleSearchAppliance
==================

This module provides a simple integration with a Google Search Appliance or Google Mini

# Features

1. Built and tested against Google Mini, software version 5

Yup, that's it for now. This module does very little, but it tries to do it very well.

# Motivation

This module was developed out of necessity. We had a need to integrate with a client's Google Mini appliance, and all of the existing .NET libraries were much more complicated and bloated than what we needed.

We didn't want to depend on a library that was over-engineered or too burdensome to use. That is why we decided to write our own!

These are the primary goals for this project:
1. Simplicity
  * The library should be easy to use, and the API should be intuitive.
2. Stability
  * As with all software, it will fail sometimes. When it does, the cause should be known, and the remedy should be clear.
3. Readability
  * The code should be clean and well organized, so that others can enjoy it.

With that in mind, it only does exactly what we need it to, and no more. If you need it to do more, then please feel free to contribute! We will be actively monitoring, reviewing and merging pull requests.
